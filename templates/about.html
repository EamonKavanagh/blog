        My name is Eamon Kavanagh.  I was born and raised in New York and recently graduated 
        from the University of British Columbia with a M.Sc in Mathematics.   
        My thesis focused on a chemotaxis model that you can read a bit more about here.
        I did my undergraduate degree at McMaster University where I graduated summa cum
        laude with a B.Sc (Hon) in Mathematics.  Currently, I'm interested in seeing how
        far I can stretch the knowledge I've gained in my many years of education.  
        This interest has caused me to explore topics such as machine learning, 
        statistics and programming.

        Right now I'm pursuing a job in data science.  With all the recent information
        about the field on the web it's hard not to be interested.  I like the fact that
        it's burgeoning industry with a lot of uncharted terrain and I'm very curious 
        to see first hand how it develops and how far it may take us.

        Apart from all of this, I rode a bicycle across the United States with a good 
        friend in the summer of 2011.  We wrote about the trip and kept a photo 
        journal <a href="http://gowestym.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <p>
        This blog is a place for me to demonstrate skills I' learned and projects 
        I've worked on.  It's a digital portfolio and a project in itself: before 
        starting this, I had no experience with web development and look at me now.
        Thanks for checking it out and enjoy your stay.
