        My name is Eamon Kavanagh.  I was born and raised in New York and recently graduated 
        from the University of British Columbia with a M.Sc in Mathematics.   
        My thesis focused on a chemotaxis model that you can read a bit more about here.
        I graduated summa cum laude from McMaster with a B.Sc (Hon) in Mathematics.

        Right now I'm pursuing a job in data science.  I like the fact that
        it's a burgeoning industry with a lot of uncharted terrain, where the amount of
        information we can wring from data is limited purely by creativity.
        I'm inspired by the recent successes of
        <a href="http://www.google.org/flutrends/" target="_blank">Google Flu Trends</a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize" target="_blank">Netflix Prize</a>
        which all took novel approaches (search result trends, crowd sourcing) to solving 
        problems.  Even in Google Flu Trends more recent 
        <a href="http://time.com/23782/google-flu-trends-big-data-problems/" target="_blank">failings</a>
        or Netflix's 
        <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/04/16/what-the-failed-1m-netflix-prize-tells-us-about-business-advice/" 
        target="_blank">decision to not implement</a> the winning algorithm there's a lot 
        to be learned.  How much can we really learn when the data we source evolves
        to our very predictions?  How do we build a robust system that can handle the
        growing amount of information we would ideally like to throw at it?  I would 
        love to not only explore the questions data science can answer but also questions
        about the how far the field can take us.

        In my free time I like to play squash, take of my plants, read, make pizza dough
        and go on the occasionally bike tour.  In the summer of 2011 I rode a bicycle
        across the United States with a good friend of mine. We kept a photo journal
        of the trip which you can read about

        <p>
        This blog is a place for me to demonstrate skills I' learned and projects 
        I've worked on.  It's a digital portfolio and a project in itself: before 
        starting this, I had no experience with web development and look at me now.
        Thanks for stopping by and enjoy your stay.
